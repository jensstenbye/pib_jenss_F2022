# pib_jenss_F2022

This repository holds my implementation of Gusfields and Prims algorithms. Here is a short description of the different files in this repository:

1. **'msa_utils.py':** Holds the different scripts shared by both Prims and Gusfields algorithm
2. **'gusfield.py':** Contains the implementation of the gusfield msa algorithm together with the script to create the custom extension order
3. **'prim.py':** Contains the implementation of the prim msa algorithm together with the script to create the custom root choice
4. **'dna_simulator.py':** Contains the scripts used to simulate DNA-sequences. Also holds the script used to simulate custom adjacency matrices
5. **'score_matrix.txt':** Contains the score matrix used in this project in the correct format
6. **'pib_env.yml':** Contains the details of the conda env used in this project. To create a conda environment from this file simply paste 'conda env create -f environment.yml' into your terminal.
